        <p>There are three topics in this syllabus:</p>
        <p>• General introduction to the philosophy and to the philosophy of science.</p>
        <p>• Concepts used by scientists and analyzed by philosophers of science (scientific explanation, laws of nature,
          pseudoscience, theoretical concepts).</p>
        <p>• The influence of external factors such as ethnicity, gender, political opinion, religiosity etc. to the scientists
          and scientific results.</p>

        <h1>Topic</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Electrical Energy-Storing Device Model for an Electric Aircraft</p>
        <h1>&nbsp;</h1>

        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The topic of this thesis is derived from Tallinn University of Applied Sciences electrical paraglider project.
          An electrical paraglider needed a power source. A battery pack of cylindrical Lithium-ion cells was chosen. The
          main purpose of the battery pack is to supply power to the exterior-rotor permanent magnet synchronous motor.</p>
        <p>Topic of the thesis is “Electrical Energy-Storing Device Model for an Electric Aircraft”. By modelling a battery,
          its design-process is reproducible and applicable to other electrical vehicles and battery cells.</p>
        <p>Result: a battery was designed, that provides 4000 W of mechanical power to the exterior-rotor permanent magnet
          synchronous machine for 23 minutes – enough time to make two flights that each reach at least an altitude of 600
          meters.</p>
        <p>Hypothesis: a battery pack with an optimal layout and the number of cells can be modelled based on the motor-
          and cell data.</p>
        <p>A block diagram of the battery was created and datasheets of ICR18650-26F cells were examined. A model was created
          based on the motor- and cell data; efficiency and runtime of the system. PTC MathCad 15.0 was used for modelling.</p>
        <p>The hypothesis of the thesis was partially proven. In addition to motor- and cell data, efficiency of the system
          is needed. The model is usable in practice and applicable to other electrical vehicles and battery cells. The model
          is adaptable to multi-motor systems and longer runtimes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With this thesis, following work resulted:</p>
        <p>• electrical energy-storing device model for an electric aircraft;</p>
        <p>• electrical schematic for the paraglider;</p>
        <p>• 3D-CAD drawing of the battery pack integrated into a housing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Based on the results of the thesis, following suggestions are made:</p>
        <p>• present the results of the thesis to electrical paraglider project-team and other interested parties;</p>
        <p>• apply the model to LiPo cells;</p>
        <p>• focus future research on battery management- and support systems;</p>
        <p>• research industrial designs and patents of battery packs and housings;</p>
        <p>• recreate the model in a well-known programming language with a GUI.</p>
